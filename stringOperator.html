<h1>JavaScript String Operators</h1>
<p>Note that strings are compared alphabetically:</p>

<p>In this example, 20 is less than 5 even though 20 is a bigger number because, alphabetically, '2' comes before '5':</p>

<p id="result"></p>

<script>
let text1 = "20";
let text2 = "5";
let result = text1 < text2;
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Is 20 less than 5? " + result;
